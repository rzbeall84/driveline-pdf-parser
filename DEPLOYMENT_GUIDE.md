# 🚀 Complete Deployment Guide: GitHub + Netlify

This guide will walk you through deploying your Tenstreet PDF Parser to GitHub and Netlify in just a few minutes.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have:
- A GitHub account ([Sign up here](https://github.com/join) if you don't have one)
- A Netlify account ([Sign up here](https://app.netlify.com/signup) if you don't have one)
- Git installed on your computer

## 🔧 Step 1: Prepare Your Local Repository

First, let's initialize Git in your project directory and prepare it for GitHub:

### 1.1 Initialize Git Repository
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/tenstreet-pdf-parser
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Tenstreet PDF Parser v2.0"
```

### 1.2 Update Package.json (Important!)
Before pushing to GitHub, update the repository URLs in `package.json`:

1. Open `package.json`
2. Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username:
   ```json
   "homepage": "https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/tenstreet-pdf-parser",
   "repository": {
     "type": "git",
     "url": "https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/tenstreet-pdf-parser.git"
   }
   ```

## 🐙 Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

### 2.1 Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Click the **"+"** button in the top right corner
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `tenstreet-pdf-parser`
   - **Description**: `Professional PDF parser for Tenstreet driver applications with comprehensive data extraction`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private (Public recommended for easier sharing)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### 2.2 Connect Local Repository to GitHub
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tenstreet-pdf-parser.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## 🌐 Step 3: Deploy to Netlify

### Option A: GitHub Integration (Recommended)

#### 3.1 Connect Netlify to GitHub
1. Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Click **"New site from Git"**
3. Choose **"GitHub"** as your Git provider
4. Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account
5. Select your `tenstreet-pdf-parser` repository

#### 3.2 Configure Build Settings
Netlify should automatically detect the settings, but verify:
- **Branch to deploy**: `main`
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `dist`

#### 3.3 Set Environment Variables
1. In the Netlify dashboard, go to **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
2. Add these variables:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL = https://5000-ik8l8iqkz5mu6m4x9026d-07641562.manusvm.computer
   VITE_DEPLOYMENT_ENV = production
   ```

#### 3.4 Deploy
1. Click **"Deploy site"**
2. Netlify will build and deploy your site automatically
3. You'll get a random URL like `https://amazing-name-123456.netlify.app`

### Option B: Manual Deploy (Alternative)

If you prefer manual deployment:

1. Build the project locally:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com)
3. Drag and drop the `dist` folder onto the Netlify dashboard
4. Your site will be deployed instantly

## 🎯 Step 4: Customize Your Deployment

### 4.1 Custom Domain (Optional)
1. In Netlify dashboard → **Domain settings**
2. Click **"Add custom domain"**
3. Enter your domain name
4. Follow DNS configuration instructions

### 4.2 Site Name
1. In Netlify dashboard → **Site settings** → **General**
2. Click **"Change site name"**
3. Choose a memorable name like `tenstreet-pdf-parser`
4. Your URL becomes `https://tenstreet-pdf-parser.netlify.app`

### 4.3 Enable Form Handling (If needed)
1. In Netlify dashboard → **Forms**
2. Enable form detection for contact forms

## 🔄 Step 5: Set Up Automatic Deployments

With GitHub integration, your site will automatically redeploy when you push changes:

```bash
# Make changes to your code
git add .
git commit -m "Update: Added new feature"
git push origin main
```

Netlify will automatically detect the push and redeploy your site!

## 🛠 Step 6: Verify Deployment

### 6.1 Test Your Live Site
1. Visit your Netlify URL
2. Test the PDF upload functionality
3. Verify all features work correctly

### 6.2 Check Build Logs
If something goes wrong:
1. Go to Netlify dashboard → **Deploys**
2. Click on the failed deploy
3. Check the build logs for errors

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Build Fails
**Problem**: Build command fails
**Solution**: 
1. Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
2. Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
3. Check build logs for specific errors

#### Environment Variables Not Working
**Problem**: API calls fail in production
**Solution**:
1. Verify environment variables are set in Netlify
2. Ensure variable names start with `VITE_`
3. Redeploy after adding variables

#### 404 Errors on Refresh
**Problem**: Page not found when refreshing
**Solution**: The `netlify.toml` file should handle this, but verify it's in your repository root.

#### API CORS Issues
**Problem**: API calls blocked by CORS
**Solution**: Ensure your API server allows requests from your Netlify domain.

## 📊 Monitoring Your Deployment

### Analytics
1. Netlify provides basic analytics in the dashboard
2. Add Google Analytics if needed
3. Monitor performance with Lighthouse

### Performance
Your site should achieve:
- **Performance**: 95+ score
- **Accessibility**: 100 score
- **Best Practices**: 100 score
- **SEO**: 100 score

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- Never commit API keys to GitHub
- Use Netlify environment variables for sensitive data
- Rotate API keys regularly

### HTTPS
- Netlify provides free SSL certificates
- Always use HTTPS in production
- Update API endpoints to use HTTPS
